# test run

# Welcome to Matt's PiCam test!
# This test is for a single camera on the raspberry pi.

# Ready to start a timelapse? (Y/N): Y

# Enter a whole number for each time incrementâ€“days, hours, minutes, seconds.

# Number of days: 7
# Number of hours: 0
# Number of minutes: 0
# Number of seconds: 0

# Take photos for 7 days. Is that right? (Y/N): Y

# Great! How many photos per hour: 5

# Sounds good. I will start at the top of the hour.

# ___what the code is doing___:
# capture photo
# determine if photo is bright enough to use
# Discard or use photo
# Add photo to folder for the day
# at end of the day, create timelapse video of the captures
# add video to video folder

# Please don't close this window until process is complete.

# Many hours later ___________________________________________

# Capture complete! Hope everything turns out great!
